# METHODOLOGY

## Study area

The study area includes subarea 48.1, which is one of the sectors where today the largest amount of krill fishing is concentrated (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure1)).

```{r Figure1, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.cap= "Subarea 48.1 and management strata considered in the spatio-temporal analysis of intrinsic productivity of Krill (BS=Brainsfield Strait, EI= Elephant Island, GS= Gerlache Strait, JOIN= Joinville Island, SSWI= South West)"}
knitr::include_graphics('index_files/figure-html/Map1.png')
```
## Monitoring Data (SISO Program)

For this analysis, data from the monitoring of the krill fishery were used, which have been systematically collected on board fishing vessels by the CCAMLR SISO (Scheme of International Scientific Observation) program. Krill sizes compositions were obtained from the entire area 48.1, which was combined in each management stratum defined at 2.1 section (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2)). For this analysis, 1,266,267 krill individuals were measured from fishery activity, the majority (~75%) from the Bransfield, Elephant and SouthWest strata. 

```{r Figure2, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="\\label{Figure 2}Sizes compositions from SISO program monitoring krill fishery by strata (BS=Brainsfield Strait, EI= Elephant Island, GS= Gerlache Strait, JOIN= Joinville Island, SSWI= South West). Red line represent recruit size"}
knitr::include_graphics('index_files/figure-html/Strata_Nochina.png')
```

The information gaps (years without sizes composition data) are not calculated because there is no autocorrelation between years, but singular estimators over time.


```{r Figure4, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.cap="Pearson correlation between krill length and temporal (years) and environmental factors in the WAP"}
knitr::include_graphics('index_files/figure-html/corr_length.png')
```



```{r Figure5, echo=FALSE,  out.width='70%', fig.cap="Random effects of location (cell) and fixed effects of environmental variables on krill length, with scattered points indicating variability in impact in estimates of the main variable."}
knitr::include_graphics('index_files/figure-html/glmm.png')
```



## Biological and fishery parameters krill

```{r}
#Create a new LB_pars Object
#To create a new LB_pars object you use the new function:
MyPars <- new("LB_pars")

#You can see the elements or slots of the LB_pars object using the
#slotNames function:
#slotNames(MyPars)
```

The model needs specifications related to both biological and fishery parameters according to species evaluated. In a descriptive way, the main parameter sets are described as follows;

**Biology**

-   von Bertalanffy asymptotic length `Linf`
-   M/K ratio (natural mortality)divided by von Bertalanffy K coefficient) `MK`
-   Length at 50% maturity (`L50`)
-   Length at 95% maturity (`L95`)

**Fishery**

-   Length at 50% selectivity (`SL50`)
-   Length at 95% selectivity (`SL95`)
-   Biological Reference Point (BRP). F/M ratio (`FM`) or Spawning Potential Ratio (`SPR`). If you specify both, the F/M value will be ignored.

**Size Classes**

-Width of the length classes (`BinWidth`)

```{r}
#MyPars <- new("LB_pars")
## A blank LB_pars object created

MyPars@Species <- "Euphausia superba"

MyPars@BinWidth <-1
MyPars@BinMax <- 70

```

These parameters were taken from previous works about krill life history and fishery [@Thanassekos2014; @Maschette2020], which are described (Table \@ref(tab:Table1).

## Model Estimation LBSPR

Recent work has shown that under equilibrium conditions (that is, constant F and no recruitment variability) and assuming the von Bertalanffy growth equation, constant natural mortality for all ages, and logistic or jack-knife selectivity, standardization of the composition of lengths of two populations with the same ratio of natural mortality to growth rate (*M/k*) and the same ratio of mortality by fishing to natural mortality (*F/M*) will be identical [@Hordyk2016]. Extension of this model to incorporate length-at-age variability and logistic selectivity confirms that, at equilibrium, the composition of the predicted duration of catch of an exploited population is primarily determined by the ratios of M/k and F/M. The analytical models developed in @Hordyk2014c suggest that with knowledge of the asymptotic von Bertalanffy length $L_{\infty}$ and the coefficient of variation in $CVL_{\infty}$, the ratio of total mortality to the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (*Z/k*) for a given population can be estimated from a representative sample of the size structure of the catch. If *M/k* (or parameters) is also known, then the results of @Hordyk2016 suggest that it is possible to estimate F/M from the composition of the catch. Often the F/M ratio has been used as a biological reference point when is 1 [@Zhou2012].

The LBSPR model requires the following parameters: an estimate of the M/k ratio, $L_{\infty}$, $CVL_{\infty}$, and knowledge of maturity by length (maturity ogive), both set parameters know in krill. This model uses data on composition by catch sizes to estimate intrinsic productivity or Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR). This concept was extracted from @Goodyear1993, where the ratio of lifetime average egg production per recruit (EPR) was calculated for fished and no fished (virgin condition) resources. An algorithm route for the calculation of the SPR is the following;

$${SPR}=\frac{EPR_{fished}}{EPR_{nofished}}$$ where;

$$
EPR_{fished} =
\sum_{a}
\begin{cases}
 E_{a},  a = 0  \\
 e^{-Z_{{a-1}}a} {E_a}, 0 < a  < a_\le{max}
 \end{cases}       
$$ 

where $Z_a$ = $M+F_a$, and $E$ is egg production at age assumed to be proportional to weight;

$$E_a \in  Mat_a W_a$$ on the other hand, the calculation of the reproductive potential is the same as that of those captured without F; $$
EPR_{nofished} =
\sum_{a}
 E_ae^{-M_a}
$$ Assuming that egg production is proportional to the size of mature fish, relative fecundity-at-size is given by;

$$
Fec_{L,g} = Mat_{L,g} L^b
$$ where b is value of the exponent to reflect differente size fecunditity relationship and g is the fraction of recruits to group.

Assuming reasonable estimates of the M/K ratio, $L_{\infty}$ (or $CVL_{\infty}$), size-at-maturity, the parameters F/M, $SL_{50}$, and $SL_{95}$ can be estimated from a representative sample of the length structure of the catch by minimizing the following multinomial negative loglikelihood function (NLL):

$$
NLL =
argmin\sum_{i}
 O_i ln\frac{\hat{P}_i}{\hat{O}_i}
$$

where $O_i$ and $\hat{O}_i$ are the observed number and proportion in length class i, respectively, and $\hat{P}_i$ is the model estimate of the probability in length class i [@Hordyk2016].

Like any assessment method, the LBSPR model relies on a number of simplifying assumptions. In particular, the LBSPR models are both equilibrium based and that the length composition data is representative of the exploited population at steady state [@Hordyk2014c; @Hordyk2016]. This methodology was implemented through the package [@Hordyk2014c] and this code and data could be visited in [LBSPRKrill](https://github.com/MauroMardones/LBSPR_Krill).

## Biological References Point (PBR) in krill.


A constant challenge for krill has been to provide indicators of stock status that can be compared to predetermined biological reference points. The intrinsic productivity or SPR is commonly used to set the limit and target reference point [@Goodyear1993; @Mace2001; @Prince2014]. By definition, the SPR is equal to 100% in an unexploited stock, and zero in a non-spawning stock (eg all mature fish have been removed, or all females have been caught). The F40%, that is, the fishing mortality that allows an escape of 40% of the biomass to MSY, is the fishing mortality rate that translates into SPR = 40%, is considered a reference point to many species [@Clark2002]. Suitable SPR biological points can be derived from hypotheses about the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship [@Brooks2013; @Hordyk2016].

However @Prince2014 provide some considerations in relation to the life strategy of the organisms and the SPR necessary to ensure the sustainability of the fishery. In this work, three types (I, II and III) are identified, which refers to the r and K life strategy. The krill is Type 1 (r-strategy), M/k=\~1 (m=0.4, k =0.43) therefore, it requires a higher save of SPR.

On the other hand, the current krill fisheries management schemes established by @CCAMLR2010, @Constable2000 proposes a decision rule scheme based on biomass that ensure the sustainability of this resource in the Southern Ocean. Through a simulation process, a 20-year projection of the krill population is generated, and a probability distribution is established around two decision rules. The first rule is based on the lowest level of exploitation allowed, around 20% of biomass, which could be consider a limit reference point. The second is the target level of the fishery, which indicates the statistical distribution of the biomass at the end of the 20-year projection under a constant catch that allows the average escape of 75% at pre-exploited levels (CCAMLR-2000 Survey). Linking this management scheme to intrinsic productivity of krill, we used two reference points for intrinsic krill productivity, 20% SPR as the limit reference point and 75% as the target to this fishery.

With this references points we can test a challenge for fishing exploitation and sustainability of krill in the Antarctic Peninsula, which is related to overfishing by recruitment. This condition occurs when the adult (reproductive) fraction has been severely reduced due to excessive fishing, jeopardizing the success of recruitment and stock replenishment in order to ensure sustainability [@Cubillos2005; @HilbornWalters92] in relation to the previously mentioned PBRs.

The LBSPR package can be used to generate the expected size composition, the SPR, and relative yield for a given set of biological and exploitation pattern parameters. The output of the `LBSPRsim` function is an object of class `LB_obj`. This is another LBSPR object, and contains all of the information from the `LB_pars` object and the output of the `LBSPRsim` function.

It is important to note that the F/M ratio reported in the LBSPR model refers to the apical F over the adult natural mortality rate. That is, the value for fishing mortality refers to the highest level of F experienced by any single size class [@Hordyk2014c]. If the selectivity pattern excludes all but the largest individuals from being exploited, it is possible to have a very high F/M ratio in a sustainable fishery (high SPR) and visceverse. Note that only the life history parameters need to be specified for the estimation model. The exploitation parameters will be estimated [@Hordyk2014c].

Two objects are required to fit the LBSPR model to length data: life-history parameters (`LB_pars`) described previously (2.4. section) and size compositions (`LB_lengths`), which contains the length frequency data. We provide a set of global size data and also by strata, with which we will be able to identify the spatial differences of the potential.

```{r}
MyLengths <- new("LB_lengths")
slotNames(MyLengths)
```

However, it is probably easier to create the `LB_lengths` object by directly reading in a `.csv`. A length frequency data of krill set with multiple years (2001-2020) by strata in 48.1 Subarea.

## Sensitivity and perfomance analysis metohodology.

Ten sensitivity scenarios based on the upper and lower range for the asymptotic length von Bertalanffy $L_{\infty}$ (55 to 65 mm) used in the base model (60 mm) were tested to identify the impact of this parameter on the SPR estimation, given that it is the parameters exhibiting the high degree of variability and one of the factors that most determines the estimates. On the other hand, the interdependence between krill and their environment is a well-known and influential factor in population dynamics, ecosystem impacts, and fishery. This interdependence also affects the reproductive potential and consequently, to any management decision that takes into account population parameters of krill. To assess the impact of individual growth variability, three scenarios of the VB k parameter were tested, representing different growth types (low = 0.2, medium = 0.7, and high = 1.2). Figure \@ref(fig:Figure3) displays a theoretical growth curve for krill based on three scenarios that were tested using LBSPR.


```{r Figure3, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Theoretical growth curves for krill based on three SPR sensitivity scenarios that were tested using LBSPR."}
# Definir los parámetros del modelo de Von Bertalanffy
L_inf <- 60
k <- c(0.2, 0.7, 1.2)
t_0 <- 0
# Crear un vector de edades
edades <- seq(0, 8, by = 0.2)
# Calcular los valores teóricos de crecimiento somático
df <- data.frame(edades = rep(edades, 
                              length(k)), 
                 k = rep(k, each = length(edades)))

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(crecimiento = L_inf * (1 - exp(-k * (edades - t_0))))
# Graficar la curva de crecimiento somático
sen <- ggplot(df, aes(x = edades, 
               y = crecimiento, 
               color = factor(k))) +
  geom_line(size=1.5) +
  xlab("Ages") +
  ylab("Length (mm)") +
  ggtitle("") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+
  scale_color_viridis_d(option="C",
                       name = "Theoretical growth",
                       labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))+
  theme_few()
sen
```

After applying each scenario using each of the parameter setting, the results of scenarios are compared with the results provided by the methods based setting (Table 1), analyzing in this way the efect of underestimation/overestimation of the parameters $L_{\infty}$ and *k*.


# RESULTS

## Model Perfomance

The results demonstrate good fits of the size structure distribution model for krill across the strata. The model accurately captures the distribution patterns of size classes, indicating its effectiveness in characterizing the population structure. The model successfully captures the variations in size distribution, reflecting the natural variability in krill populations across different strata. These findings suggest that the model can be utilized as a valuable tool for understanding and predicting size structure dynamics in krill populations (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4)).

plotSize(fitei,

```

The Joinville strata exhibits the least model fits, supposedly attributed to the limited available size compositions data spanning only three years (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure5)).

For all the other strata (Gerlache, EI and SSWI) the model predict sizes compositions in a correct way for all the years (for details see [LBSPRKrill](https://github.com/MauroMardones/LBSPR_Krill)).

The difference between the observed accumulated size compositions for each stratum and compare it with the expected size composition at a target SPR (75% SPR). In the simulation of the structure in its virgin condition (without fishing), the red bars represent each stratum. Additionally, the overlap with the average structures observed during the years of fishery monitoring can be visualized. The SSWI Gerlache and EI strata exhibit the greatest differences from the simulated structure, possibly due to the significant contribution of juveniles in these strata. Conversely, the BS and JO strata demonstrate the closest resemblance to the simulated structure (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure6)).

Furthermore, ogive maturity curve specific to each stratum and year, as well as the estimated length selectivity curve, are presented in (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure6mat)). These curves offer crucial insights into the fishery's impact on the population and its reproductive status, providing measures of the population's vulnerability to fishing mortality. Notably, the Braisnfield stratum stands out with a lower proportion of mature individuals, suggesting a higher prevalence of juveniles. It is important to note that the same maturity parameters were applied across all strata.

## Comparing producivity between years and Stratas

The analysis of the krill population's reproductive potential across different years and strata reveals significant differences. Brainsfield and Gerlache strata exhibit a low reproductive potential below the proposed management target of 75% in the last year, with values of 0.121 and 0.085, respectively, falling even below the limit reference point. This condition arises from the concentration of a substantial number of immature individuals (juveniles) in these strata, which are being exploited by the fishery, thereby hindering their reproductive cycles from completing. On the contrary, the Elephant Island stratum demonstrates higher spawning potential ratio (SPR) levels in recent years, reaching 0.421 in 2019, which aligns closer to the management objective. This discrepancy is attributed to the spatial distribution of krill, as the Elephant Island stratum possesses a larger proportion of adult individuals compared to other strata. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure8) provides a visual representation of the SPR trends across years and strata, clearly indicating the references (yellow line = 75% SPR Objective and Red line = 20% Limit SPR).

The Elephant Island stratum has exhibited a higher prevalence of adult fraction in fishing catches, leading to an increase in reproductive potential in recent years. Conversely, the Bransfield and Gerlache strata experience intense recruitment overfishing, with their reproductive potential falling significantly below the recommended target at 54% and 66.5%, respectively.

All the estimated values of SPR and their associated variance by stratum and by year can be identified in  Table \@ref(tab:Table2).

## Sensitivity and perfomance analysis

The results of the methods in the reference setting are compared to the obtained under overstimation/underestimation in intrinsic productivity regarding asymptotic length von Bertalanffy $L_{\infty}$ parameter in krill. First, it was possible to identify that for all strata, the impact of low $L_{\infty}$ ranges under the base model (60 mm) overestimates the level of reproductive potential krill with values between 42% and 32% (Bransfield and Elephant Island strata respectively). Regarding higher $L_{\infty}$ settings, the model tends to underestimate the reproductive potential with values between -25% and -30% (Gerlache and Joinville strata) Figure \@ref(fig:Figure9),  Table \@ref(tab:Table3).

Regarding the three growth levels of the species (high, medium, low) referred to the parameter $k$, it was possible to identify that high and medium growth types result in very low SPR (spawning potential ratio) estimates compared to slow and medium growth. In fact, with high individual growth, the model estimates that SPR levels would be very close to the target management levels (75% SPR) and far from the limit reference level of 20% (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure10),  Table \@ref(tab:Table4)).
