# ABSTRACT

Various approaches have been employed to comprehend the spatio-temporal dynamic of the krill productivity along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, by using both design and model-based methodologies. One way is through the Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR), a fishery approach capable of providing insights into the population status. We assess the spatial and temporal SPR variability of Antarctic krill by fitting a Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) method using length composition database with 20 years the fishery activity, and further tested the model sensitivity through a range of life history parameters and environmentally-conditioned population growth scenarios. LBSPR method allowed identifying spatial heterogeneity in the population dynamics of krill. Results showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity among fishing strata in the WAP, where Gerlache Strait had was consistently lower than the 20% of SPR as reference point in all time series analized compared with Elephant, Bransfield Strait, South West and Joinville strata. Futhermore, we test the influence of various growth parameters in SPR, like K and Linf, which are sensitive to environmental variables such as chlorophyll. Given the apparent spatial heterogeneity in intrinsic productivity identified through our SPR estimates, we propose using this approach to establish a management procedure based on a control rule for each stratum. This method adjusts the allocation of current catch limits in line with the new management strategy of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). By integrating knowledge about spatial krill dynamics and its reproductive potential, advice can be recommended to ensure the sustainable management of krill populations in Subarea 48.1.

# INTRODUCTION


One structural component of the Southern Ocean (SO) is the Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*; hereafter krill), a keystone species responsible for efficient energy transfer between lower and higher trophic levels [@Morley2020; @Meyer2020] within a delicate ecological balance strongly influenced by both environmental and oceanographic conditions [@McBride2021; @Kawaguchi2023].  Along the SO, the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a critical region for krill productivity, serving as a major spawning and recruitment area, and also, as a vital region for breeding and foraging  for a number of krill predators [@Warwick-Evans2022; @Perry2019; @Perry2020; @Atkinson2019a]. 

Krill is the largest marine biomass on Earth [@Atkinson2019a; @Atkinson2009] and has been the subject of increasing fishing exploitation over the last 50 years [@Atkinson2009; @Flores2012a; @Flores2012; @Kruger2021; @Pinones2016],  The krill fishery, since the early 1990s, has been concentrated between WAP and the Scotia Sea (FAO statistical subareas 48.1 and 48.3) and is where 70% of the krill population resides [@Atkinson2019a; @Hill2016; @McBride2021; @SantaCruz2022; @Siegel2013]. 


The SO, and particularly in WAP, is considered one of the most sensitive areas to Climate Change (CC) and has already experienced fast changes in various dimensions [@Turner2005]. Over the last 40 years, climate driven changes have resulted in warming waters [@Morley2020; @Turner2005], declines in seasonal sea ice extent and duration [@Stammerjohn2008; @Stammerjohn2008a] and changes in phytoplankton productivity [@Morley2020; @Saba2014; @Siegel2013]. These environmental changes hasve resulted in changes in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the krill population in SO and inside WAP [@Atkinson2019a; @Flores2012; @Kawaguchi1994; @Flores2012a; @ILAIA2021; @McBride2021; @Pinones2016; @Saba2014; @Walsh2020, @Reiss2020; @SantaCruz2018; @Veytia2021; @Ryabov2023]. However, its magnitude and influence occurs at different spatial and temporal scales, therefore also implying localized spatiotemporal changes of the krill population within the WAP [@Atkinson2019a; @Kruger2019; @SantaCruz2022].


This temporal and spatial heterogeneity is translated into changes in individual movement patterns, ontogeny and biological traits resultings in changes in intrinsic productivity of the krill population in WAP [@Perry2020; @Veytia2021; @Keyl2008]. The intrinsic productivity refers to the ability of a population to reproduce and sustain itself and this depended on reproductive and somatic conditions [@Begon2006; @Molles2019]. A very common way to estimate the intrinsic productivity in commercially exploited marine populations, like krill, is the average number of offspring produced by the population over its lifetime known as Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) and it depends on the growth rate and fishery selectivity [@Canales2021; @Hordyk2014c; @Hordyk2016; @Jensen1996; @Prince2018; @Rudd2017a; @Cousido-Rocha2022]. The intrinsic productivity or SPR has been widely used due to the advantages related with its easy biological interpretation and also because it uses one of the most abundant and reliable sources of information obtained from fishing activity, the length compositions [@Canales2021; @Chong2019; @Hordyk2016]. In another hand, this indicator allows us to know the population status, and consequently,  provides elements for management setting the limit and target reference point in fisheries [@Canales2021; @Goodyear1993; @Hordyk2016; @Mace2001; @Rudd2017a]. Numerous length-based assessment methods have been used to quantify alterations in intrinsic productivity, specifically the SPR [@Hordyk2016;  @Rudd2017a; @Canales2021; @Froese2018] in commercially exploited marine populations. To know the intrinsic productivity (SPR) of krill we use the Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) [@Hordyk2016], which has been developed for data-limited fisheries context, where few data are available other than a representative sample of the length composition of the vulnerable portion of the population (i.e., the catch) with the added understanding of the life history of the species

Regarding fishery management, the Commission for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has been a constant challenge for search for a biological and ecosystem framework for krill and dependent species [@Hill2019; @Watters2013; @Constable2000; @Constable2023]. Despite acquiring new and revised data, which routinely adjusts catch limits based on updated stock assessment,  CCAMLR has refrained from adjusting the operational krill trigger level, that relies on the utilization of a measure, known as the trigger level, which was established in 1991 based on acoustic biomass estimation, sparking questions about the responsiveness of krill management compared to traditional approaches, raising questionings in regard of and this goes against the efficiency of this a management procedure for any commercially exploited population [@Hill2019; @Punt2016; @Zhao2023]. As examples of fishery management in a global context, government organizations and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) has developed frameworks and proposals with different Biological References Points (BRP) according to the population dynamic of the exploited species, ecosystem components, as well as regarding to quality of the available data, which is a key element to promote sustainability not only of the fishery but also of the biological population and marine communities [@Punt2016; @Holland2010a]. In relation to this, the management and conservation of Antarctic fisheries resources is shifting from a simplistic approach to a new management strategy based on BRP either on the population, as well as the ecosystem [@Watters2013; @Hill2016; @Hill2019]. CCAMLR is working on revised conservation measures of the krill fishery to further strengthen its management and conservation of resources exploited and inhabiting the area, focusing on promoting both precautionary and ecosystem-based approach, considering the associates and dependent species and habitats within the ecosystem [@CCAMLR2021a; @McBride2021; @Warwick-Evans2022]. Spatial and temporal changes in the population and community structure is a relevant issue within the new strategy, where localized or reduced spatial scales have been proposed to identify changes and give management advice considering status and overlap ecosystem components [@Watters2013; @Warwick-Evans2022]. 

One of the scientific interests of this study focuses on the environmental effects of different oceanographic drivers in the WAP on krill populations with the purpose of testing scenarios and their impact on SPR in each strata. We aimed to examine the population structure and determine if environmental factors were drivers for changes in krill sizes in a historical perspective across spatial range.

According to what was previously described, any proposal for a management procedure on krill based on reference points must consider the relevant aspects of the new strategy, which indicate knowledge about population status to estimate or adjust precautionary harvest rates and explicit and quantitative risk assessment in spatial allocation. In this study, we analyzed the intrinsic productivity with a SPR estimation for krill population considering spatial heterogeneity inside the WAP and the effect of both different environmental and growth scenarios. Finally, we explore the use of BRP for the design of management procedures and harvest control adjustment of catch limits based on SPR for sustainable management of the krill fishery in Subarea 48.1.

# METHODOLOGY

## Study area

The study area includes Subarea 48.1 in the WAP, which is one of the sectors where a large part of the fishing activity of this species occurs. In order to have the finest spatial definition of krill population dynamics and analysis, we analyze data considering five  strata currently used by  CCAMLR for the new management strategy defined in @Dornam2021 and @Zhao2023, namely Bransfield Strait, Elephant Island, Gerlache Strait, Joinville Island and South West (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure1)).


## Monitoring Data (SISO Program)

Data from the monitoring of the krill fishery were used, which have been systematically collected on board fishing vessels by scientific observers as part of the CCAMLR 
Scheme of International Scientific Observation (SISO) program. Krill length compositions were obtained from the entire Subarea 48.1 for the 2000-2020 period, which was grouped by year and management stratum defined at previous section (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure1)). A database containing 2,330,194 length records was employed. This database has information about vessel, nationality, georeferenced, among others. The data were grouped into monthly intervals and strata bins of 1 millimeter. Additionally, mean sizes and deviations were calculated, allowing for the weighting of the data for modeling purposes using *tidyverse* library [@Wickham2019]



## Environmental drivers on krill growth

Three main drivers of environmental variables available for the WAP area were assessed for this analysis: 1) Sea Superficial Temperature (SST), using  ERA5 monthly mean data on single levels from 1991 to present setting on native resolution; 2) Sea Ice Index Concentration (SIC) from from Nimbus-7 in GeoTIFF format files, from November 1978 to present; 3) Chlorophyll (Chlo) data was downloaded from Bio-Geo-Chemical, L4 (monthly and interpolated) from Satellite Observations. All this information  was downloaded from satellite observation using E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021; doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148.)  Post-processing techniques, such as data cleaning and handling algorithms, engaged in the manipulation of spatial data, employing techniques such as rasterization and projection transformations facilitated by the *sf* and *ncdf4* R libraries [@Pebezma2018; @Pierce2021]. We fitted a GLMM to predict Length with Year (formula: Length ~ Year + Chl + SIC + SST). The model included spatial component (cell) as random effect (formula: ~1 | cell). Krill length compositions from fishery data was correlated with environmental variables by using Pearson correlations test, and General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The Pearson correlation method is a statistical measure used to quantify the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It provides a numerical value, called the Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as r), which indicates the strength and direction of the linear association between the variables [@Makowski2020]. The GLMM was used to estimate the relationship between the response variable (krill length) and the predictor variables (such as Chl, SST and SIC index) while controlling for the effects of random factors [@Bates2015]. 

The estimated slope coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between variables. The variance components indicate the amount of variation that is explained by the random factors. Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation. Pearson and GLMM were carried out with the *lm4r* and *easystats* packages [@Bates2015; @Lüdecke2022]. Analysis and manipulation of variables on a fine spatial scale were gridded in 25 x 25 km cells using *raster* and *CCAMLRGIS* package [@Hijmans2022; @Thanassekos2022].

## LBSPR Model 

 The LBSPR method assumes the reproductive characteristics of the species based on the life history parameters, being able to establish management strategies for long-lived species with low reproductive output as well as highly reproductive species with a high growth constant such as krill. LBSPR uses length composition data and assumptions about biological and fisheries parameters to make a rapid assessment of stock status relative to virginal (or unfished) levels assuming equilibrium conditions. Previous work has shown that under equilibrium conditions (that is, constant F and no recruitment variability) and assuming the von Bertalanffy growth equation, constant natural mortality for all ages, and logistic or jack-knife selectivity, standardization of the composition of lengths of two populations with the same biological and selectivity parameters will be identical  [@Canales2021; @Hordyk2016]. The LBSPR model depends on both biological and fishery parameters taken from previous works about krill life history and fishery [@Maschette2020; @Thanassekos2014], which are described in S1 Table 1. Biological parameter sets include von Bertalanffy asymptotic length, M/K proportion (natural mortality and von Bertalanffy K in a coefficient ratio), Length at 50% maturity (L~50~), Length at 95% maturity (L~95~), L, CVL, and knowledge of maturity by length (maturity ogive). Principal fishery parameters are included, as Length at 50% selectivity (SL~50~), Length at 95% selectivity (SL~95~), F/M ratio (fishing mortality and natural mortality). It should be noted that the parameter estimates are the same for all strata. The methodological development from which the SPR calculation is derived was extracted from [@Goodyear1993], where the ratio of lifetime average egg production per recruit (EPR) was calculated for fish and non-fish resources. Like any assessment method, the LBSPR model relies on a number of simplifying assumptions. In particular, the LBSPR models are both equilibrium based and that the length composition data is representative of the exploited population at steady state [@Hordyk2014c; @Hordyk2016], which is also an assumption for krill. Model equation, data and auto-reproducible guide to model application could be found in S1 Appendix. 

## Biological References Point to krill

By definition, the SPR is equal to 100% in an unexploited stock, and zero in a non-spawning stock (e.g. all mature fish have been removed, or all females have been caught). The F~40%~, that is, the fishing mortality that allows an escape of 40% of the biomass to Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), is the fishing mortality rate that translates into SPR~40%~, is considered a BRP to many species  [@Brooks2013; @Clark2002]. @Prince2014 offers insightful considerations regarding BRP and life history for many species. The study delineates three distinct strategies, denoted as I, II, and III, corresponding to the r and K life strategies. These strategies are contingent upon varying levels of reproductive productivity (high or low) and the nature of population growth (fast or slow). Krill is an organism of high productivity and relatively rapid growth [@Thanassekos2014], which places it as a Type 1 specie (r-strategy), with M/k= ~ 1 (m=0.4, k =0.43) therefore, it requires a higher save of SPR [@Hordyk2016; @Prince2014]. These considerations about the life strategy must be taken into account in the design of any fishery management procedure based in SPR. The current krill fishery management schemes established by @CCAMLR2010, proposes a harvest control rule scheme based on biomass that ensures the sustainability of this resource with a precautionary approach incorporating ecosystem objectives to setting catch limits in the SO [@Constable2000; @Zhao2023; @Hill2016; @Hill2019]. The first rule is based on the lowest level of exploitation allowed, around 20% of biomass, which could be considered a limit reference point. The second is the target level of the fishery, which indicates the statistical distribution of the biomass at the end of the 20-year projection under a constant catch that allows the average escape of 75% at pre-exploited levels. In this sense, and to translate this into reference levels of protection biomass, we used two reference points for intrinsic krill productivity, SPR~20%~ as the limit reference point and SPR~75%~ as the target to this fishery, which reproduces and considers what was proposed by the HCR of CCAMLR and is used currently. 

## Sensitivity scenarios analysis.

SPR estimates from the LBSPR model are highly sensitive to maximum length and growth parameters, which in turn, varies according to changes in environmental conditions [@Hidalgo2018; @Portner2001]. First, we tested ten values between the lower and upper range for *L~inf~* (55 to 65 mm), and compared that with a base case model (60 mm). Secondly, we assessed three theoretical *k* (low = 0.2, medium = 0.7, and high = 1.2) (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure2)). Each scenario was applied to the five strata within the 48.1 subarea, which makes up a total of 65 outputs. Results were compared with those provided by S1 Table 1 serving as the base model. This analytical approach enabled the examination and comparison of the impacts from potential underestimation or overestimation of the parameters." *L~inf~* and *k*. 

# RESULTS

## Environmental influences on krill growth

Pearson analysis demonstrated that all variables are statistically significant in terms of their effect on krill growth, however, there are notable correlations such as a negative effect of Chlorophyl on krill size could be verified (55% correlation). Also a negative relationship between SIC and chlo (-%71) was recorded (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure3)). The model total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.40) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.30. The model intercept, corresponding to Year = 0, is at -24.25 (95% CI [-99.95, 51.46], t(268) = -0.63, p = 0.529).  The effect of Year component is statistically non-significant and positive in the relation (beta = 2.61e-03, 95% CI [-7.99e-03, 0.01], t(268) = 0.49, p = 0.628; Std. beta = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.12]).  Chlo is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.54, 95% CI [-0.73, -0.34], t(268) = -5.45, p < .001; Std. beta = -0.47, 95% CI [-0.65,-0.30]). The effect of SIC is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -2.25e-03, 95% CI [-7.24e-03, 2.75e-03], t(268) = -0.89, p = 0.377; Std. beta = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.08]). The effect of SST is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.35], t(268) = 0.67, p = 0.502; Std. beta = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.23]). Finally,  no statistically significant influence of location on krill length, krill size appeared consistent across the studied spatial scale (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure4)). 


## LBSPR Model Output

Model outputs  demonstrate good fits of the length compositions distribution to LBSPR model for krill across the strata (S1 Appendix, Fig. 4, 5). The model accurately captures the distribution patterns of size classes, indicating its effectiveness in characterizing the population structure and captures the variations in size distribution between years, reflecting the natural variability in krill populations and between years and strata. In the simulation of the structure in its virgin condition (no fished) in each stratum. The overlap with the length structures observed during the years of fishery monitoring can be visualized. The SSWI Gerlache and EI strata exhibit the greatest differences from the simulated structure.  Conversely, the BS and JO strata demonstrate the empirical data are closer to the virginal condition simulated by the model (S1 Appendix, Fig. 6). Bransfield stratum stands out with a lower proportion of mature individuals, suggesting a higher prevalence of juveniles. It is important to note that the same maturity parameters were applied across all strata (S1 Appendix, Fig. 7).

Krill SPR varied significantly across years and strata. Both Bransfield and Gerlache strata exhibit a low SPR below the proposed management target of 75% in 2020 with values of 12.1% and 8.5%, respectively, falling even below the limit reference point of 20%. In contrast, the Elephant Island stratum demonstrates higher SPR in recent years, reaching 42.1% in 2019, which aligns closer to the management objective (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure5)). The Elephant Island stratum showed a higher prevalence of adults with  an increased SPR in recent years. Conversely, the Bransfield and Gerlache strata experienced intense recruitment overfishing, with SPR values falling significantly below the recommended target at 54 and 66.5 point, respectively. All the estimated values of SPR and their associated variance by stratum and by year are shown in Table \@ref(fig:Table2).


## Sensitivity analysis

Low L~inf~ values under the base case model (60 mm) overestimates SPR between 42% and 32%, for Bransfield and Elephant Island strata, respectively. Higher L~inf~ values tended to underestimate SPR between -25% and -30% for Gerlache and Joinville strata, respectively (Table \@ref(fig:Table3); Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure6)). Interestingly,lower L~inf~  values in the LBSPR model translates into higher SPR estimation levels, which is consistent across all strata. The three tested growth rates (low, medium, high) showed different SPR estimates.  High and medium growth types resulted in very low SPR estimates compared to low growth. Particularly, high individual growth would generate SPR values very close to the target management levels (75% SPR) and far from the limit reference level of 20% (Table \@ref(fig:Table3); \@ref(fig:Figure7)).

# DISCUSSION

In recent years, the identification of changes in population dynamics of krill within Subarea 48.1 has posed significant challenges. Temporal-spatial patterns of catch concentration and productivity have undergone significant variations, while the ecosystem has already begun experiencing the impacts of environmental changes [@Hill2016; @McBride2021; @SantaCruz2022]. Our study identified changes in spatio-temporal intrinsic productivity or Spawning Potential Ratio of krill inside 48.1, and identified the reproductive potential in a prolonged period of krill in an explicit spatial context. 


## Fishery data as population indicators

Length composition from fishing data allows obtaining information on the population structure changes of the target species. In this case, data from the krill fishery showed these changes occurred during the last two decades and throughout an area ecologically sensitive and with intense fishing activity  (Krafft et al., 2015). To identify changes in the krill population, we used  length compositions data of catch, which is one of the most representative pieces of information on the population dynamics of exploited marine resources (Chong et al., 2019; Prince & Hordyk, 2018). This type of data is abundant and informative about status populations (Canales et al., 2021), biomass estimates (Smith et al 2023), and a key component into integrated stock assessment model (Wang et al 2021). Changes in the availability, distribution, and concentration, performance of the marine exploited populations such as krill have been reflected in this kind of data, and the use of this type of data and size-based models to know the status of the population has been widely used in the world fisheries and allows recommendations for sustainable management (Canales et al., 2021:2023; Froese et al., 2018; Hordyk et al., 2016; Rudd., 2017; Reiss et al., 2016). The appropriate representation of length compositions is crucial for assessing the overall health and intrinsic productivity of krill populations and to design management strategies. 


## Environmental drivers and impacts in krill intrinsic productivity

Changes in krill population dynamics in the Antarctic Peninsula are shown in various ways, including  distribution, biomass, recruitment and phenology. The main drivers of these changes are related to different environmental variables and population structure of krill in the AP  [@Flores2012; @Flores2012a; @Pinones2016; @Reiss2020; @Saba2014; @Siegel2013; @Veytia2021; @Walsh2020]. While acknowledging the influence of environmental factors on variables such as biomass and recruitment  [@Flores2012; @Perry2020; @ichii2023], it remains imperative to systematically assess spatial and temporal shifts and their impacts on the krill Spawning Potential Ratio. Increased chlorophyll levels have been found to promote krill recruitment [@Flores2012a; @Saba2014], but at the same time, and as a compensation, it can produce population declines in mature individuals, thereby diminishing reproductive potential. @Steinke2021b identified a positive correlation between female maturity and krill recruitment, but our study expanded this analysis by evaluating the spawning potential of the entire population, encompassing both males and females. This broader approach may account for disparities in the findings. Nevertheless, we recognize that understanding how fishing practices and environmental conditions influence the physiological and reproductive status of krill remains one of the foremost challenges in the context of climate change.

After establishing the environmental influence on reproductive potential, we theoretically integrated this insight into the model via three growth scenarios in k parameter, which showed adverse environmental conditions resulting in low growth having significant implications for calculating intrinsic productivity. Results in different SPR outputs, confirmed the influence of environmental conditions on reproductive potential. With a  low growth scenario (k = 0.2), intrinsic productivity levels increase in all strata (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure7)). This occurs given that with a low k, that is, an organism with low productivity and slow growth [@Prince2014], which implies a higher level of resilience to anthropogenic and environmental changes. On the other hand, the other two types of growth (medium and high) do not have major implications in the model and do not significantly change the SPR outputs. Climate change impacts in the WAP can directly affect intrinsic productivity of krill, further influencing long-term sustainability. Keeping a process for monitoring these changes in krill productivity provides valuable insights into the overall health and resilience of the WAP ecosystem and krill population. In this regard, this type of analysis can help identify krill characteristics and in turn give advice for management. With these findings, it is demonstrated that any stock assessment models or monitoring indicators design  that seeks to identify the krill status, for example, based on SPR, must consider environmental variability in its methodological considerations.

## Spatial and Temporal heterogeneity in intrinsic krill productivity

In the vast majority of marine populations the spatial heterogeneity in patterns of distributions is a rule and not an exception [@Cadrin2023], but understanding and quantifying these spatial differences continues to be a challenge for science and management of this type of species. Identifying changes in krill population dynamics and structure in main hotspots of fisheries has been one of the biggest challenges in recent years as the fishery has been concentrated for the last 20 years in Subarea 48.1  [@Atkinson2019a; @Atkinson2022; @McBride2021; @Reiss2020; @Watters2013]. SPR can give signals about status in reduced areas, because it is related to overfishing by recruitment [@Clark2002; @Goodyear1993]. This condition occurs when the reproductive fraction has been severely reduced due to excessive fishing, jeopardizing the success of recruitment and stock replenishment [@Canales2023; @Clark2002; @HilbornWalters92]. We verified that the reproductive potential of krill varied among management strata and has changed through the years. Elephant Island is the strata with the highest SPR levels, showing a positive trend in the last years of the series, reaching levels of 56% in 2020. This year is particularly interesting given the high levels of primary productivity concentration in this area that could have had an impact on a high level of recruitment  [@Saba2014; @Walsh2020] and consequently, a decrease in reproductive potential at the population level. In contrast, the Gerlache stratum exhibits low SPR levels (below the 25% limit) in the whole time series analyzed, with values of 6% in 2007. This stratum was characterized by a reduced productivity explained by the significant abundance of immature juvenile individuals, as highlighted in studies by @Perry2020 and @Veytia2021. Krill fishery activity is expanded to this strata and it becomes imperative to prioritize this area for management strategies, given the overlapping ecosystem components in this strata, because it emerges as a recurrent foraging area for krill predators, including whales [@Pallin2023; @Reisinger2022]. In Bransfield strata, we note that throughout the series of analyzes the SPR has had a decreasing trend in recent years with levels of 12% SPR in 2020. This may be related to the growing fishing activity that has increased and concentrated in this sector [@Atkinson2019a; @SantaCruz2018], which has targeted older individuals, losing the reproductive capacity of the population, and as a consequence of this a decrease in the levels of intrinsic productivity. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity of SPR of krill has consequences for other phenomena such as productive yields that are manifested in fishing indicators in WAP [@Kruger2019; @SantaCruz2022]. From a holistic point of view, differences spatial and temporal in SPR in krill can significantly impact long-term for maintaining ecosystem balance and species diversity [@Hill2016; @McBride2021]. Higher SPR ensures a larger number of offspring, increasing the chances of population recovery after disturbances or by environmental fluctuations and reduced SPR may cause decreased food availability for dependent predators [@Kruger2019], hence, fluctuations in intrinsic productivity can have cascading effects on their populations. 

Spatial heterogeneity in the population structure of krill has been widely described in different areas of the SO specifically in the WAP. Reiss et al (2016) identified demographic heterogeneity associated with maturity patterns, Perry (2020; 2021) identified recruit hotspots and nursery areas associated with life stages and his relations with environmental drivers. However, most of the previously described studies are descriptive. In contrast, our approach LBSPR is a model-based method that allows us to have a quantitative approximation of the spatio-temporal differences in the krill population structure and thus provide recommendations for conservation and management. 


## Sensivity SPR with growth parameters

As part of good practices in the use of stock assessment models, like LBSPR, suggests test scenarios to determine the impact of uncertainty sources on the output, detects biases and improves reliability [@Carvalho2017; @Chong2019]. Indeed, few studies have performed parameter sensitivity analyses for these methods with real case studies [@Canales2021; @Cousido-Rocha2022; @Hordyk2016]. We sensitized the model to the growth parameters of krill, and found that all scenarios confirm the influence of L~inf~ on the overall SPR results. We were able to verify that in scenarios with a lower L (55 mm), SPR increases even at management target levels (75%) (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure7)). This situation is repeated in the same way in all the strata. Regarding variability in krill SPR based on sensitivity scenarios, life history parameters were a factor with high influence of SPR estimators. This result supports those in previous studies of length-based analysis about growth type [@Cousido-Rocha2022; @Prince2018; @Rudd2017a], but it is the first time that this type of analysis has been carried out on krill. In this context, two aspects emerge. Firstly, despite recognizing spatial variability in demographic structures among strata, we employed the same set of life history parameters and assumptions for our analysis. Secondly, we identified an information gap regarding biological parameters in krill, crucial for both our analysis and the stock assessment process. Consequently, conducting studies to determine specific life history and maturity parameters by stratum becomes imperative to refine our findings. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis could serve as a valuable tool to address these existing knowledge gaps.


## CCAMLR krill fishery management and spatial heterogeneity

A precautionary management for the sustainability of commercial krill exploitation relies on maintaining a healthy population through sustainable harvesting practices, which can be influenced by variations in reproductive potential. In a standard fishery science context, a robust management procedure typically includes a design of the Harvest Control Rule (HCR), which is an algorithm through which the mortality, exploitation rate or quota to be implemented for the estimation of the quotas is chosen [@bentley2010; @Punt2016]. CCAMLR has identified some gaps in this management procedure and is currently under review [@Hill2016; @Kawaguchi2023; @Watters2009; @Zhao2023] to ensure sustainability in this scheme. Nowadays, krill fishery harvest strategy in Subarea 48.1  is based on a global constant catch that is not related to changes in a population and/or ecosystem indicator, such as maintaining a biomass at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield i.e.). This means that, regardless of a level of biomass or indicator status at sustainable levels of the krill, the rule is constant and is established at the levels defined as trigger level and its subsequent special assignments defined in @CCAMLR2021a. In this context, the revised CCAMLR management strategy considers three pivot elements: i) update biomass estimates, whether at macro or small scale; ii. develop a stock assessment approach to estimate precautionary harvest rates or/and quotas;  and iii) an overlap analysis for the spatial allocation of catch limits [@Warwick-Evans2022; @Trathan2023]. Despite these proposals assessing krill population dynamics at a finer level, these schemes are not yet operational for decision making [@Watters2013; @Kawaguchi2023].  

Our work focuses on proposing a HCR for the adjustment of catch limits and, consequently, a scheme for spatial allocation for each stratum within subarea 48.1 based in SPR. With associated reference level, this approach allows triggering decision mechanisms such as the exploitation rate or adjusting catch limits by strata and can be incorporated in the new CCAMLR scheme. The management procedure adjustment presented in this study identified the spatial differences (strata) of SPR, and the HCR changes the harvest level (catch limit) according to the levels of that indicator krill status, which is an adaptation to the rule commonly used and known as a *"hockey stick"* as follow;


$$
\text{Captura}(SPR) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{si } SPR \leq 0.2 \\
\frac{1}{2}(2 - 10(SPR - 0.2)^3 + 15(SPR - 0.2)^4 - 6(SPR - 0.2)^5) & \text{si } 0.2 < SPR \leq 0.5 \\
\frac{1}{2}(2 - 10(0.5 - SPR)^3 + 15(0.5 - SPR)^4 - 6(0.5 - SPR)^5) & \text{si } 0.5 < SPR \leq 0.75 \\
0 & \text{si } SPR > 0.75
\end{cases}
$$

$$
F = \begin{cases}
    F_{MSY}  & \text{if } \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} \geq 1 \\
    F_{MSY} \left( \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} - 0.2 \right) / 0.75 & \text{if } 0.2 \leq \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} < 0.75 \\
    0 & \text{if } \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} < 0.2
\end{cases}
$$
where *i* and *j* indicates the SPR calculated by stratum and year, and  SPR~MSY~ represent references in SPR~75%~, which is a common BRP to all stratum.  SPR calculation scheme can be easily updated each time when new data comes to be processed in modeling. The proposal for spatial adjustment and allocation of krill catch limits is not new and has considered different criteria including the catch history, predator demand and krill standing stock by Small Scale Management Unit (SSMU) [@Constable2023; @Hewitt2004; @Watters2009]. It should be noted that this control rule and spatial allocation scheme is based on a single stock assessment model for krill, it offers a tactical, operational and quantifiable procedure, which is recommended for adequate fishery management [@Punt2016], and constitutes the cutting-edge of management procedure in the exploited marine species in fishing countries [@Hilborn2020a]. It also constitutes one of the first allocation spatial catches on krill based on the management strata defined in @CCAMLR2010. 

The use of assessment models based on single stock for krill, as LBSPR, can be considered biased given that it does not incorporate ecological components. However, through this type of exercises, mechanistic relationships can be established for complex marine dynamics and, thereby, provide tactical inputs for the proper management and conservation of this species. One of the proposals to link this type of methodological approximations to the krill fisheries management, is to consider the spatial heterogeneity of krill within Subareas,  and in the next step, to regulate the fishing effort that is carried out on the fraction of juvenile individuals. This measure could bring benefits to the rest of the population in the medium and long term. In this sense, incorporating the findings regarding the changes in krill intrinsic productivity, as examined in this study, into precautionary and adaptive management strategies for this resource and its fishery is of utmost importance.



# CONCLUSION

This study undertakes the first analysis of the intrinsic productivity of krill in Subarea 48.1 using the quantitative method LBSPR (Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio). We delve into the intricate dynamics of this vital species, unraveling temporal and spatial scales within one of the regions with the greatest fishing pressure for this species. These spatio-temporal variations in intrinsic productivity serve as a fundamental basis as a management procedure, which seeks to integrate the complexities of krill  population dynamics into a framework aligned with CCAMLR revised management strategy for Subarea 48.1. The proposed management procedure based on SPR, and translate to a Harvest Control Rule, could be a quantitative element to adjust and regulate the catch limits that are currently established,  and in turn, it aligns with spatial allocation inside subarea 48.1 into stratas, which contributes to a paradigm shift towards a spatially explicit management scheme. By aligning fishing practices with the natural flows of krill productivity, this approach lays the foundation for a useful coexistence between fishing exploitation and the Antarctic ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the sustainability of this crucial marine species.
