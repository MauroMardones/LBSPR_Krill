# ABSTRACT

Various approaches have been employed to comprehend the spatio-temporal krill dynamic in Subarea 48.1 (Western Antarctic Peninsula), by using both design and model-based methodologies. One way for comprehending the intrinsic productivity of krill is through the concept known as the Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR). Understanding SPR is beneficial as it provides insights into the population status, which, in turn, can serve as a crucial Biological Reference Point (BRP) for guiding management recommendations. We assess the spatial and temporal SPR variability of Antarctic krill by fitting a Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) model, through the analysis of one of the most abundant and representative data on the commercially exploited marine population  such as length compositions.  We analyze 20 years of fishery monitoring and further tested sensitivity through a range of life history parameters and environmental conditions scenarios. Results showed a spatial heterogeneity of the krill intrinsic productivity among fishing strata in the Antarctic Peninsula, where Extra strata is lower compared with Elephant, Brainsfield, South West and Joinville strata. It is also identified spatial heterogeneity in population processes and according to that we propose a management procedure based in a control rule based on the SPR for each stratum, adjusting a strata allocation of the current catch limit within the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) management context. By integrating knowledge about spatial krill dynamics and its reproductive potential, advice can be recommended to ensure the sustainable management of krill populations in Subarea 48.1.

# INTRODUCTION

The western Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem is a critical region of the Southern Ocean for populations of Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*; hereafter krill) serving as a major spawning and recruitment area and as an overwintering hotspot, especially within Bransfield Strait. Over the last 40 years, climate driven changes have resulted in warming waters, declines in seasonal sea ice extent and duration [@Stammerjohn2008a; @Stammerjohn2008], changing trends phytoplankton productivity [@Saba2014; @Siegel2013].

Additionally, changes have impacted the population dynamics of krill, resulting in distribution changes with consequent contraction of the population in the southwest Atlantic Ocean toward the peninsula [@Atkinson2009]. In addition, changes in the population structure have also verified in krill in recent years [@Reiss2020]. The mentioned temporal and spatial changes have implications for the reproductive potential of the species and this, therefore, for intrinsic productivity.

One way to understand and measure changes in intrinsic productivity is through assessing the ratio of krill reproductive potential. There are many length-based assessment methods to understand this changes between years [@Rudd2017a; @Froese2018; @Hordyk2016; @Canales2021]. On the other hand, one of the advantages of these methods is to use one of the most reliable and abundant sources in the sampling of fishing activities, such as size structures [@Canales2021].

Spatial and temporal changes in the population structure have been a relevant issue within CCAMLR (Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) fisheries management schemes. In this sense, new more localized or reduced spatial scales have been proposed to identify changes in these scales. Despite these proposals to identify krill population dynamics at a finer level, these schemes are not yet operational for decision making [@Hill2016; @McBride2021].

We then propose to identify differences in krill reproductive potential at the finer spatial and temporal scales, propose a specific reference point considering the spatial scale, and ultimately provide recommendations for sustainable management of the krill fishery through intrinsic productivity in Subarea 48.1 on the Antarctic Peninsula in the Southern Ocean.

# METHODOLOGY



## Model Estimation LBSPR

Recent work has shown that under equilibrium conditions (that is, constant F and no recruitment variability) and assuming the von Bertalanffy growth equation, constant natural mortality for all ages, and logistic or jack-knife selectivity, standardization of the composition of lengths of two populations with the same ratio of natural mortality to growth rate (*M/k*) and the same ratio of mortality by fishing to natural mortality (*F/M*) will be identical [@Hordyk2016]. Extension of this model to incorporate length-at-age variability and logistic selectivity confirms that, at equilibrium, the composition of the predicted duration of catch of an exploited population is primarily determined by the ratios of M/k and F/M. The analytical models developed in @Hordyk2014c suggest that with knowledge of the asymptotic von Bertalanffy length $L_{\infty}$ and the coefficient of variation in $CVL_{\infty}$, the ratio of total mortality to the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (*Z/k*) for a given population can be estimated from a representative sample of the size structure of the catch. If *M/k* (or parameters) is also known, then the results of @Hordyk2016 suggest that it is possible to estimate F/M from the composition of the catch. Often the F/M ratio has been used as a biological reference point when is 1 [@Zhou2012].

The LBSPR model requires the following parameters: an estimate of the M/k ratio, $L_{\infty}$, $CVL_{\infty}$, and knowledge of maturity by length (maturity ogive), both set parameters know in krill. This model uses data on composition by catch sizes to estimate intrinsic productivity or Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR). This concept was extracted from @Goodyear1993, where the ratio of lifetime average egg production per recruit (EPR) was calculated for fish and non-fish resources. An algorithm route for the calculation of the SPR is the following;

$${SPR}=\frac{EPR_{fished}}{EPR_{nofished}}$$ where;

$$
EPR_{fished} =
\sum_{a}
\begin{cases}
 E_{a},  a = 0  \\
 e^{-Z_{{a-1}}a} {E_a}, 0 < a  < a_\le{max}
 \end{cases}       
$$ where $Z_a$ = $M+F_a$, and $E$ is egg production at age assumed to be proportional to weight;

$$E_a \in  Mat_a W_a$$ on the other hand, the calculation of the reproductive potential is the same as that of those captured without F; $$
EPR_{nofished} =
\sum_{a}
 E_ae^{-M_a}
$$ Assuming that egg production is proportional to the size of mature fish, relative fecundity-at-size is given by;

$$
Fec_{L,g} = Mat_{L,g} L^b
$$ where b is value of the exponent to reflect differente size fecunditity relationship and g is the fraction of recruits to group.

Assuming reasonable estimates of the M/K ratio, $L_{\infty}$ (or $CVL_{\infty}$), size-at-maturity, the parameters F/M, $SL_{50}$, and $SL_{95}$ can be estimated from a representative sample of the length structure of the catch by minimizing the following multinomial negative loglikelihood function (NLL):

$$
NLL =
argmin\sum_{i}
 O_i ln\frac{\hat{P}_i}{\hat{O}_i}
$$

where $O_i$ and $\hat{O}_i$ are the observed number and proportion in length class i, respectively, and $\hat{P}_i$ is the model estimate of the probability in length class i [@Hordyk2016].

Like any assessment method, the LBSPR model relies on a number of simplifying assumptions. In particular, the LBSPR models are both equilibrium based and that the length composition data is representative of the exploited population at steady state [@Hordyk2014c; @Hordyk2016]. This methodology was implemented through the package [@LBSPR2021; @Hordyk2014c] and this code and data could be visited in [LBSPRKrill](https://github.com/MauroMardones/LBSPR_Krill).
