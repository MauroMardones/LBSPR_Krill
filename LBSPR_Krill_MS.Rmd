# ABSTRACT

Several approaches have been employed to comprehend the spatio-temporal dynamic of the krill productivity along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, by using both design and model-based methodologies. One way is through the Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR), a fishery approach capable of providing insights into the population status. We assess the spatial and temporal SPR variability of Antarctic krill by fitting a Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) method using length composition database with 20 years the fishery activity, and further tested the model sensitivity through a range of life history parameters and environmentally-conditioned population growth scenarios. LBSPR method allowed identifying spatial heterogeneity in the population dynamics of krill. Results showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity among fishing strata in the WAP, where Gerlache Strait was consistently lower than the 20% of SPR as reference point in all time series analysed compared with Elephant, Bransfield Strait, South West and Joinville strata. Furthermore, we test the influence of various growth parameters in SPR, like K and Linf, which are sensitive to environmental variables such as Chlorophyll. Our findings underscore the necessity of incorporating environmental variability into stock assessment models, such as those based on SPR, to accurately assess krill stock conditions. Given the apparent spatial heterogeneity in intrinsic productivity identified through our SPR estimates, we propose using this approach to establish a management procedure based on a control rule for each stratum. This method adjusts the allocation of catch limits in line with the new management strategy of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). By integrating knowledge about spatial krill dynamics and its intrinsic productivity, advice can be recommended to ensure the sustainable management of krill populations in Subarea 48.1.

# INTRODUCTION


One structural component of the Southern Ocean (SO) is the Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*; hereafter krill), a keystone species responsible for efficient energy transfer between lower and higher trophic levels [@Meyer2020; @Morley2020] within a delicate ecological balance strongly influenced by both environmental and oceanographic conditions [@Kawaguchi2023; @McBride2021]. Along the SO, the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), is considered one of the most sensitive areas to Climate Change (CC) and has already experienced fast changes in various dimensions [@Turner2005]. Over the last 40 years, climate driven changes have resulted in warming waters [@Morley2020; @Turner2005], declines in seasonal sea ice extent and duration [@Stammerjohn2008; @Stammerjohn2008a] and changes in phytoplankton productivity [@Morley2020; @Saba2014; @Siegel2013]. Considering that this area is a critical region for krill productivity, serving as a major spawning and recruitment area, and also, as a vital region for breeding and foraging  for a number of krill predators [@Atkinson2009; @Perry2019; @Perry2020; @Warwick-Evans2022], these environmental changes have resulted in changes in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the krill population [@Reiss2020]. Even more, its magnitude and influence occurs at different spatial and temporal scales, therefore also implying localised spatio-temporal changes of the krill population within the WAP [@Atkinson2019a; @Kruger2019; @SantaCruz2022].

Krill is the largest marine biomass on Earth [@Atkinson2009; @Atkinson2019a; @McBride2021] and has been the subject of increasing commercial exploitation over the last 50 years [@Atkinson2009; @Flores2012; @Flores2012a; @Kruger2021; @Pinones2016]. Since the early 1990s, the fishery has been concentrated between WAP and the Scotia Sea (FAO statistical subareas 48.1 and 48.3) and is where 70% of the krill population resides [@Atkinson2009; @Hill2016; @McBride2021; @SantaCruz2022; @Siegel2013]. The Commission for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is a decision-making body which advises with the objective of conserving Antarctic marine life using the best available science. An specific objective is minimising risks associated with harvesting that may affect the exploited populations and protect the marine ecosystem [@Constable2000; @Constable2023 ; @Hill2019; @Watters2013]. (CCAMLR, 2013, Article II). The current krill fishery management scheme established by CCAMLR [@CCAMLR2021a], proposes a harvest control rule based on biomass that ensures the sustainability of this resource with a precautionary approach incorporating ecosystem objectives to setting catch limits in the Convention Area [@Constable2000; @Hill2016; @Hill2019; @Zhao2023]. The first rule is based on the lowest level of exploitation allowed, around 20% of biomass, which could be considered a limit reference point. The second is the target level of the fishery, which indicates the statistical distribution of the biomass at the end of the 20-year projection under a constant catch that allows the average escapement of 75% at pre-exploited levels. This scheme results in the set of  a regional precautionary catch limit within the WAP area, based on a synoptic estimate of biomass which was established in 1991 [@Constable2011; @Watters2013]. 

Traditionally, fishery management strategies worldwide often use feedback loops in response to information about the status to update stock assessments and adjust catch limits or closures accordingly [@Hill2019; @Punt2016; @Warwick-Evans2022; @Zhao2023; Constable2002]. In this regard, CCAMLR has monitoring programs acquiring new and revised krill data, however it has refrained from using a feedback loop to adjust the operational measure known as trigger level. This lack of adjustment in management procedure may compromise the efficacy of krill management and, consequently, its sustainability. Besides, there are concerns that a regional catch limit is not sufficient to prevent spatially localized, indirect impacts on ecological components [@Kawaguchi2023; @Watters2013]. At a global scale, fishery management entities, including governmental agencies and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), have established management frameworks centered on Biological Reference Points (BRP). These frameworks are constructed considering the population dynamics of target species, ecosystem interactions, and the reliability of available data [@Hill2019; @Maunder2013; @Punt2016]. These management frameworks are a key element to promote sustainability, not only of the fishery, but also of the biological population and marine communities [@Holland2010a; @Punt2016]. To address these issues, CCAMLR is undertaking a revision of its management strategy framework and conservation measures for the krill fishery. The challenge is to enhance resource management and conservation by adopting a more precautionary and ecosystem-based fisheries management [@McBride2021; @Trathan2023; @Warwick-Evans2022]. In this new management strategy, spatial and temporal changes in the population and community structure is a relevant issue where localized or reduced spatial scales have been proposed to identify changes and give management advice considering status and overlap ecosystem components [@Warwick-Evans2022; @Watters2009; @Watters2013]. A significant obstacle in addressing these challenges is the absence of a comprehensive quantitative performance metric based on BRP to assess the degree to which factors influencing spatial heterogeneity have affected krill populations within the WAP and other regions in SO [@Hill2019; @Watters2013]. Consequently, a paradigm shift is proposed for Antarctic fisheries management, transitioning from the current reductionist framework to a more complex strategy grounded in BRP. This new approach should incorporate spatial considerations and account for both krill population dynamics and ecosystem integrity [@Hill2016; @Hill2019; @Watters2013].

Changes in krill population structure, as evidenced by alterations in movement patterns, ontogeny, and biological traits, can significantly impact the intrinsic productivity of krill populations in WAP, both spatially and temporally [@Keyl2008; @Perry2020; @Veytia2021]. The intrinsic productivity refers to the ability of a population to reproduce and sustain itself and this depends on reproductive and somatic conditions [@Begon2006; @Molles2019]. A common way to estimate the intrinsic productivity in commercially exploited marine populations, like krill, is the average number of offspring produced by the population over its lifetime known as Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) and it depends on the growth rate and fishery selectivity [@Canales2021; @Cousido-Rocha2022; @Hordyk2014; @Hordyk2016; @Jensen1996; @Prince2018; @Rudd2017a]. SPR can give signals about status in more or less exploited areas, because it is related to overfishing by recruitment [@Clark2002; @Goodyear1993]. This condition occurs when the reproductive fraction has been severely reduced due to excessive fishing, jeopardizing the success of recruitment and stock replenishment [@Canales2023; @Clark2002; @HilbornWalters92]. The intrinsic productivity or SPR has been widely used due to the advantages related with its easy biological interpretation and also because it uses one of the most abundant and reliable sources of information obtained from fishing activity, the length composition of the catches [@Canales2021; @Chong2019; @Hordyk2014]. Numerous length-based assessment methods have been used to quantify alterations in intrinsic productivity in commercially exploited marine populations, specifically the SPR [@Canales2021; @Froese2018; @Hordyk2016; @Rudd2017a]. To calculate the SPR of krill we use the Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) [@Hordyk2016], a modeling approach enables the derivation of SPR and relative fishing pressure estimates from length composition and life history data [@Hordyk2014; @Hordyk2016; @LBSPR2021; @Prince2014; @Prince2018; @Prince2014]. In addition, the SPR can be used as an indicator that allows to know the population status, and consequently, provides elements for establishing fishery management setting the limit and target as BRPs in fishery management [@Goodyear1993; @Mace2001]. Environmental factors play a crucial role in shaping the SPR by affecting essential life history traits of krill [@Bahlburg2023; @Veytia2021]. Fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability directly affect metabolic rates, growth, and reproductive output [@Cheung2013; @Croll2023; @Kawaguchi2023; @Koenigstein2016; @Poloczanska2016; @Shao2023; @Sylvester2021; @Sylvester2021; @Trivelpiece2011a; @Veytia2020]. In  marine environments, elevated temperatures can accelerate metabolism, potentially increasing growth but also demanding greater energy expenditure @Flores2012; @Saba2014; Veytia2020]. Conversely, nutrient limitation can constrain primary production and growth population, reducing food availability for higher trophic levels [@Sylvester2021; @Saba2014].

This study quantifies intrinsic productivity across five strata currently used by CCAMLR for the new management strategy defined in @Dornam2021 and @Zhao2023 within the WAP, incorporating the influence of varying growth conditions under changing environmental regimes. The resulting spatially explicit productivity estimates will be employed to evaluate population status and investigate the applicability of biological reference points, such as spawning potential ratio (SPR), within management frameworks. By integrating explicit and quantitative overlapping risk assessments, this research aims to develop harvest control rules utilizing the Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) model. This approach seeks to ensure the sustainable management of the krill fishery in Subarea 48.1, aligning with the innovative fishery management strategy proposed by CCAMLR.

# METHODOLOGY

## Study area

The study area includes Subarea 48.1 in the WAP, which is where the majority of krill fishing activity occurs. In order to have the finest spatial definition of krill population dynamics and analysis, we analyzed data considering five strata currently used by CCAMLR namely Bransfield Strait, Elephant Island, Gerlache Strait, Joinville Island and South West (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure1)). While these strata were delineated for smaller-scale management and spatial planning, they did not initially incorporate biological or population-specific characteristics. Nevertheless, these strata provide a suitable framework for our analysis

## Monitoring Data (SISO Program)

We obtained data from the monitoring of the krill fishery, which have been systematically collected on board fishing vessels by scientific observers as part of the CCAMLR Scheme of International Scientific Observation (SISO) program. Krill length compositions comprising 2,330,194 individual records were obtained from the entire Subarea 48.1 for the 2000-2020 period, which was grouped by year and management stratum (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure1)). The database included information on vessel, nationality, georeferenced fishing locations, among other data. The data were grouped into 1 millimeter bins by month and geographic strata. To enhance the representation of size-based population structure for subsequent modeling, mean sizes and standard deviations were calculated and weighted using the *tidyverse* package [@Wickham2019].

## Environmental drivers on krill growth

We obtained data for three environmental variables within the WAP for this analysis: 1) Sea Superficial Temperature (SST), using ERA5 monthly mean data from 1991 to present; 2) Sea Ice Index Concentration (SIC) from from Nimbus-7 in GeoTIFF format files, from November 1978 to present; 3) Chlorophyll (Chl) data from Bio-Geo-Chemical, L4 (monthly and interpolated) from Satellite Observations. We downloaded all data from satellite observation using E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021; doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148.) and using native resolution, which represents the finest level of detail captured by the measurement instrument or sampling method. Post-processing techniques, including data cleaning and handling algorithms, manipulation of spatial data, rasterization and projection transformations were facilitated by the *sf* and *ncdf4* libraries [@Pebezma2018; @Pierce2021]. We used a General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to estimate the relationship between the response variable (krill length) and the predictor variables (formula: Length ~ Year + Chl + SIC + SST) while controlling for the spatial component (cell) as a random effect (formula: ~1 | cell) [@Bates2015]. The estimated slope coefficients and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) indicate the strength of the relationship between variables, in which coefficients that overlap zero indicate no relationship with krill length. The variance components indicate the amount of variation that is explained by the random factors. We computed CIs and p-values using a Wald t-distribution approximation. 
We also tested for correlations between krill length compositions from fishery data and environmental variables using a Pearson correlation test. The Pearson correlation method is a statistical measure used to quantify the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It provides a numerical value, called the Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as *r*), which indicates the strength and direction of the linear association between the variables [55]. Pearson tests and the GLMM were carried out with the *lm4r* and *easystats* packages [@Bates2015; @Lüdecke2022]. Analysis and manipulation of variables on a fine spatial scale were gridded in 25 x 25 km cells using *raster* and *CCAMLRGIS* package [@Hijmans2022; @Thanassekos2022].

## LBSPR Model 

The Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) method is a fishery assessment tool that utilizes the length distribution of fish samples to estimate reproductive characteristics based on life history parameters [@Hordyk2016]. It aids in fishery management by offering insights into overfishing risks with minimal data, applicable to both long-lived species with low reproductive output and highly reproductive species with a high growth rate, such as krill. LBSPR uses length composition data and assumptions about biological and fisheries parameters to make a rapid assessment of stock status relative to virgin (or unfished) levels. Previous work has shown that under equilibrium conditions (that is, constant F and no recruitment variability) and assuming von Bertalanffy growth function, constant natural mortality for all ages, and logistic or jack-knife selectivity, standardization of the composition of lengths of two populations with the same biological and selectivity parameters will be identical [@Canales2021; @Hordyk2016]. The LBSPR model depends on both biological and fishery parameters taken from previous works about krill life history and fishery [@Maschette2020; @Thanassekos2014], which are described in S1 Table 1. Biological parameters include von Bertalanffy asymptotic length, M/K proportion (natural mortality and von Bertalanffy K in a coefficient ratio), Length at 50% maturity (L~50~), Length at 95% maturity (L~95~), CVL, and maturity by length (maturity ogive). Fishery parameters include Length at 50% selectivity (SL~50~), Length at 95% selectivity (SL~95~), and the F/M ratio (fishing mortality and natural mortality). By fitting the model to krill length data, we can evaluate its performance. Since most estimates of biological and reproduction parameters for krill have been made at the global SO scale [@Bahlburg2023], we assumed the same set of parameters for the five strata of subarea 48.1.

The methodological development from which the SPR calculation is derived was extracted from [@Goodyear1993], where the ratio of lifetime average egg production per recruit (EPR) was calculated for fish and non-fish resources. Like any assessment method, the LBSPR model relies on a number of simplifying assumptions. In particular, the LBSPR models assume population equilibrium and that the length composition data is representative of the exploited population at steady state [@Hordyk2014; @Hordyk2016], which we assume is true for krill. We provide the model equation, data and auto-reproducible guide to model application (S1 Appendix).

## Biological References Point to krill

By definition, the SPR is equal to 100% in an unexploited stock, and zero in a non-spawning stock (e.g. all mature fish have been removed, or all females have been caught). The F~40%~, that is, the fishing mortality that allows an escape of 40% of the biomass to Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), is the fishing mortality rate that translates into SPR~40%~, and is used as a BRP for many species [@Brooks2013; @Clark2002]. @Prince2014 offers insightful considerations regarding BRP and the life history for many species. The study delineates three distinct strategies, denoted as I, II, and III, corresponding to the r and K life history strategies. These strategies are contingent upon varying levels of reproductive productivity (high or low) and the nature of population growth (fast or slow) [@macarthur1967; @perry1999; @jorgensen2007]. Krill is an organism with high productivity and relatively rapid growth [@Thanassekos2014], which corresponds to a Type 1 species (r-strategy), with M/k  ~ 1 (m=0.4, k =0.43) therefore, it requires a higher SPR for population replenishment [@Hordyk2016; @Prince2014]. These considerations about the life strategy must be taken into account in the design of any fishery management procedure based in SPR. The current krill fishery management schemes established by @CCAMLR2010, proposes a harvest control rule based on biomass that ensures the sustainability of this resource with a precautionary approach incorporating ecosystem objectives to setting catch limits in the SO [@Constable2000; @Zhao2023; @Hill2016; @Hill2019]. The first rule is based on the lowest level of exploitation allowed, around 20% of biomass, which could be considered a limit reference point. The second is the target level of the fishery, which indicates the statistical distribution of the biomass at the end of the 20-year projection under a constant catch that allows the average escapement of 75% at pre-exploited levels. In this way, and to translate this into reference levels of protection biomass, we used two reference points for intrinsic krill productivity, SPR~20%~ as the limit reference point and SPR~75%~ as the target for this fishery, which reproduces and considers what was proposed by the HCR of CCAMLR and is used currently.

## Sensitivity scenarios analysis.

Environmental factors exert a significant influence on fish growth rates. Consequently, individual growth trajectories may serve as proxies for the environmental conditions encountered by an organism during its lifespan [@Croll2023]. SPR estimates from the LBSPR model are susceptible to changes in growth parameters [@Coscino2024; @Hordyk2016; @Baudron2014; @Hidalgo2011; @Hidalgo2018; @Portner2001]. Considering this, we tested 10 values between the lower and upper range for L~inf~ (55 to 65 mm) and compared that with a base case model (60 mm). Secondly, we evaluated three theoretical k scenarios related to environmental conditions, expressed like low growth (*k* = 0.2), medium growth (*k*= 0.7), and high growth (*k*= 1.2) (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure2)). Each scenario was applied to the five strata within the 48.1 subarea, which makes up a total of 65 combined scenarios. Results were compared with those provided by S1 Table 1 serving as the base model. This analytical approach investigates how fluctuations in environmental drivers, specifically those influencing the growth rates (parameters L~inf~ and *k*) of organisms like krill, can affect the reproductive success of the species. By examining these interconnections, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying population dynamics and potential vulnerabilities in response to future environmental changes.

# RESULTS

## Environmental influences on krill growth

Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that all three environmental variables were statistically significant in terms of their effect on krill population structure, with a strong negative relationship of Chlorophyll on krill size (0.55) and a very strong negative relationship between Sea Ice Index and Chlorophyll (0.71) (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure3)). The GLMM, which accounted for the combined effect of all variables on krill length, further delineated these relationships, with 40% of the variability explained (conditional R^2^ = 0.40). The effect of chlorophyll on krill length was strongly negative, and in this way, we deduce the influence of the environment on krill growth rates, while sea ice and temperature were not important (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure4)). The effect of Year component is statistically non-significant and positive in the relation (beta = 2.61e-03, 95% CI [-7.99e-03, 0.01], t(268) = 0.49, *p* = 0.628; Std. beta = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.12]). The effect of SIC and SST are statistically non-significant and negative (*p* = 0.377; Std. beta = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.08] and *p* = 0.502; Std. beta = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.23] respectively). Chlorophyll is the only statistically significant and negative factor on krill length (beta = -0.54, 95% CI [-0.73, -0.34], t(268) = -5.45, *p* < .001; Std. beta = -0.47, 95% CI [-0.65,-0.30]). Additionally, it was found that location (cell) as fixed effects (marginal R^2^) is of 30% and had no influence on krill length across the studied spatial scale (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure4)).

## LBSPR Model Output

LBSPR model outputs exhibited satisfactory goodness-of-fit, as evidenced by the residual analysis of length composition distributions for krill across the strata. (S1 Appendix, Fig. 4, 5). The model accurately captured the distribution patterns of size classes, indicating its effectiveness in characterizing the population structure and also showing the variations in length distribution due to the natural variability in krill populations between years and strata. Simulations of length distribution of unfished populations with observed length distribution within each stratum showed that SSWI Gerlache and EI strata exhibit the greatest differences from the simulated structure. Conversely, the BS and JO strata demonstrate the empirical data are closer to the virginal condition simulated by the model (S1 Appendix, Fig. 6). Bransfield stratum stands out with a lower proportion of mature individuals, suggesting a higher prevalence of juveniles. It is important to note that the same maturity parameters were applied across all strata (S1 Appendix, Fig. 7). Krill SPR varied significantly across years and strata. Notably, none of the strata yielded SPR above the fishery management target of 75% in any year examined, and all strata, with the exception of Joinville (only 3 year data), contained years with SPR below the limit reference point of 20% (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure5)). In fact, intrinsic productivity in Gerlache remained consistently below SPR~20%~ for all but two years in the time series. Over the study period, Bransfield showed a declining trend in SPR consistent with recruitment overfishing, while Elephant Island showed an increasing trend in SPR, which corresponded to the increased prevalence of adults in the catch in recent years (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure2); Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure5)). All the estimated values and their associated variance of SPR by stratum and by year are shown in Table \@ref(tab:Table1).

## Sensitivity analysis

Low L~inf~ values under the base case model (60 mm) resulted in increased estimation of SPR between 42% and 32%, for Bransfield and Elephant Island strata, respectively. Higher L~inf~ values tended to produce reduced estimates of SPR between -30% and -25% for Gerlache and Joinville strata, respectively (Table \@ref(tab:Table2); Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure6)). In general, lower L~inf~ values in the LBSPR model translates into higher SPR estimation levels, which is consistent across all strata. The three curve growth rate tested (low, medium, high) showed different SPR estimates. High and medium growth types resulted in very low SPR estimates compared to low growth. Particularly, high individual growth would generate SPR values very close to the target management levels (75% SPR) and far from the limit reference level of 20% (Table \@ref(tab:Table2); \@ref(fig:Figure7)).

# DISCUSSION

## Spatial and Temporal heterogeneity in intrinsic krill productivity

In most marine populations, spatial heterogeneity in distribution patterns is the rule rather than the exception [@Cadrin2023]. This consideration has become increasingly important for krill, as the fishery, which historically dispersed its effort over a broad spatial scale, has progressively concentrated its activities within a smaller region over the past 20 years, particularly in Subarea 48.1. Population dynamics and changes in spatial patterns can be influenced by fishing activity, or it is fishing activity that "follows" these changes, concentrating in places where the krill population is most productive. On the other hand, changes in the ecosystem triggered by environmental and ecological variables are also direct drivers that cause changes in the population structure of krill on the spatial scale [@Hill2016; @McBride2021; @SantaCruz2022]. Consequently, it is imperative to account for spatial heterogeneity in stock structure and distribution when evaluating stock status. This is particularly critical for krill, as the fishery has transitioned from a widely dispersed to a highly concentrated spatial distribution. Such concentration may amplify the potential impacts of harvesting. To date, a quantitative assessment of spatial heterogeneity in stock status for krill has been lacking, hindering effective management [@Atkinson2019a; @Atkinson2022; @McBride2021; @Reiss2020; @Watters2013].

Analysis of length composition data collected from krill fisheries monitoring reveals spatial heterogeneity in population structure and its changes over time. We used length composition data from catches for several reasons. This type of data is one of the most representative pieces of information on population dynamics of exploited marine resources [@Canales2021; @Chong2019; @Prince2018]. Also, it is abundant and informative about status populations [@Canales2021] , biomass estimates [@Smith2023] and a key component into integrated stock assessment model [@Wang2021]. Changes in the availability, distribution, and concentration, performance of the marine exploited populations such as krill have been reflected in this kind of data, and the use of this type of data and size-based models to know the status of the population has been widely used in the world fisheries and allows recommendations for sustainable management [@Canales2021; @Canales2023; @Froese2018; @Hordyk2016; @Rudd2017a; @Reiss2020]. 

We verified that the intrinsic productivity of krill varied among management strata and has changed through the years using LBSPR model. Elephant Island had the highest SPR levels, showing a positive trend in the last years of the series, reaching a high of 56% in 2020. In contrast, the Gerlache stratum exhibited low SPR levels (below the 25% limit) in the whole time series analyzed, with 6% in 2007. This stratum is characterized by reduced productivity and a relatively high abundance of immature juvenile individuals, as highlighted in studies by [@Perry20207] and [@Veytia2021]. Given that the krill fishery activity has expanded to this strata, it is imperative to prioritize this area for effective management, especially because it is also as a recurrent foraging area for krill predators, including whales [@Pallin2023; @Reisinger2022]. In Bransfield strata, the SPR has decreased throughout the study period, with the lowest level of 12% SPR occurring in 2020. This may be related to the growing fishing activity that has increased and concentrated in this strata [@Atkinson2009; @SantaCruz2018], which has targeted older krill, thus, reducing reproductive capacity of the population and consequently, decreasing intrinsic productivity. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity of SPR of krill provides a biological mechanism for the consequential changes observed in indicators of productivity yield across the WAP [@Kruger2019; @SantaCruz2022]. From a holistic point of view, these spatiotemporal differences in krill SPR are likely to significantly impact the maintenance of long-term ecosystem balance and species diversity [@Hill2016; @McBride2021]. Higher SPR ensures a larger number of offspring, increasing the chances of population recovery after disturbances or environmental fluctuations, while reduced SPR may cause decreased food availability for dependent predators [@Kruger2021]; hence, fluctuations in intrinsic productivity can have cascading effects on their populations.

Spatial heterogeneity in the population structure of krill (demographic patterns, recruitment) has been widely described for different areas of the SO, specifically in the WAP [@Perry2019; @Perry2020; @Reiss2020]. However, these studies are mostly descriptive. In contrast, our approach, LBSPR, is a model-based method that allows us to have a quantitative approximation of the spatio-temporal differences in the krill population structure that can be used to provide meaningful spatially-explicit recommendations for conservation and management, consistent with CCAMLR’s mandate for ecosystem-based fishery management.

This result supports those in previous studies of length-based analysis about growth type [@Cousido-Rocha2022; @Prince2018; @Rudd2017a], but it is the first time that this type of analysis has been carried out on krill. In this context, two aspects emerge. Firstly, despite recognizing spatial variability in demographic structures among strata, we employed the same set of life history parameters and assumptions for our analysis. Secondly, we identified an information gap regarding biological parameters in krill, crucial for both our analysis and the stock assessment process. Consequently, conducting studies to determine specific life history and maturity parameters by stratum becomes imperative to refine our findings. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis could serve as a valuable tool to address these existing knowledge gaps.


## Environmental drivers and impacts in krill intrinsic productivity

Changes in krill population dynamics are shown in various ways, including distribution, biomass, recruitment and phenology. The main drivers of these changes are related to different environmental variables that are happening in WAP [@Flores2012; @Flores2012a; @Pinones2016; @Reiss2020; @Saba2014; @Siegel2013; @Veytia2021; @Walsh2020]. While acknowledging the influence of environmental factors on variables such as biomass and recruitment [@Flores2012; @Perry2020; @ichii2023], it remains imperative to systematically assess spatial and temporal shifts and their impacts on the krill intrinsic productivity. Our findings indicate a strong, negative relationship between Chlorophyll concentration and krill size, suggesting that environmental conditions significantly influence krill population structure. Similar findings were found in @Croll2023; @Flores2012; @Pinkerton2021; @Pinones2016; @Saba2014 and @Steinke2021b. While Sea Ice Index was correlated with Chlorophyll, it did not directly impact krill length in our GLMM model. While previous research has highlighted the temporal variability in krill population characteristics [@Kawaguchi1994; @Perry2020], our analysis incorporating year as a factor did not reveal significant influences on krill length. Similarly, location and Sea Surface Temperature did not contribute meaningfully to explaining length variation. This implies that chlorophyll is the primary environmental driver of length variability, and therefore in the growth rates of this species within the study area. Increased Chlorophyll levels have been linked to enhanced krill recruitment [@Flores2012; @Stammerjohn2008a], but paradoxically, they can also lead to population declines in mature individuals, consequently reducing SPR. While @Steinke2021b established a positive correlation between female maturity and krill recruitment, our study expanded this analysis by assessing the spawning potential of the entire population, including both males and females. This broader perspective may explain discrepancies with previous analysis. However, understanding the interplay between fishing activities and environmental conditions on krill physiology and reproduction remains a significant challenge in the face of climate change.

A good practice in the use of stock assessment models, like LBSPR, involves testing scenarios to determine the impact of uncertainty sources on the output, detects biases and improves reliability [@Carvalho2017; @Chong2019]. Indeed, few studies have performed parameter sensitivity analyses for these methods with real case studies [@Canales2021; @Cousido-Rocha2022; @Hordyk2016]. Initially, we adjusted the model to the growth parameters of krill, and found that all scenarios confirm the influence of Linf on the overall SPR results. We were able to verify that in scenarios with a lower *L* (55 mm), SPR increases even at management target levels (75%) (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure7)). This situation is repeated in the same way in all the strata. Regarding variability in krill SPR based on sensitivity scenarios, Linf was a parameter with high influence of SPR estimators. Then, we incorporated three scenarios of different theoretical growth that depend on environmental conditions using distinct growth rate constants (*k*). For instance, under environmental conditions characterized by elevated chlorophyll levels, which can lead to a decreased growth rate constant, we observed significant positive impacts on intrinsic productivity. With a slower growth scenario (*k* = 0.2), intrinsic productivity levels increased in all strata ((Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure7)). This occurs given that with a smaller *k*, that is, an organism with lower productivity and slower growth [@Hordyk2014], there is a higher level of resilience to anthropogenic and environmental changes. On the other hand, the other two types of growth (medium and high) did not have major implications in the model and did not significantly change the SPR outputs. Environmental conditions that influence krill growth dynamics will subsequently impact its intrinsic productivity, potentially affecting its long-term sustainability., further influencing long-term sustainability. A quantitative tool capable of detecting changes in krill productivity, like LBSPR, provides valuable insights into the overall health and resilience of the WAP ecosystem and krill population. In this context, such analysis plays a critical role in identifying key characteristics of krill, thereby informing management strategies. The findings underscore the necessity for stock assessment models and monitoring indicators, particularly those based on SPR, to incorporate environmental variability into both their methodological frameworks and the interpretation of outcomes.

## CCAMLR krill fishery management and spatial heterogeneity

A precautionary management for the sustainability of commercial krill exploitation relies on maintaining a healthy population through sustainable harvesting practices, which can be influenced by variations in reproductive potential. In a standard fishery science context, a robust management procedure typically includes a design of the Harvest Control Rule (HCR), which is an algorithm through which the mortality, exploitation rate or quota to be implemented for the estimation of the quotas is chosen [@bentley2010; @Punt2016]. CCAMLR has identified some gaps in this management procedure and is currently under review [@Hill2016; @Kawaguchi2023; @Watters2009; @Zhao2023] to ensure sustainability in this scheme. Nowadays, krill fishery harvest strategy in Subarea 48.1  is based on a global constant catch that is not related to changes in a population and/or ecosystem indicator, such as maintaining a biomass at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield i.e.). This means that, regardless of a level of biomass or indicator status at sustainable levels of the krill, the rule is constant and is established at the levels defined as trigger level and its subsequent special assignments defined in @CCAMLR2021a. In this context, the revised CCAMLR management strategy considers three pivot elements: i) update biomass estimates, whether at macro or small scale; ii. develop a stock assessment approach to estimate precautionary harvest rates or/and quotas;  and iii) an overlap analysis for the spatial allocation of catch limits [@Warwick-Evans2022; @Trathan2023]. Despite these proposals assessing krill population dynamics at a finer level, these schemes are not yet operational for decision making [@Watters2013; @Kawaguchi2023].  

Our work focuses on proposing a HCR for the adjustment of catch limits and, consequently, a scheme for spatial allocation for each stratum within subarea 48.1 based in SPR. With associated reference level, this approach allows triggering decision mechanisms such as the exploitation rate or adjusting catch limits by strata and can be incorporated in the new CCAMLR scheme. The management procedure adjustment presented in this study identified the spatial differences (strata) of SPR, and the HCR changes the harvest level (catch limit) according to the levels of that indicator krill status, which is an adaptation to the rule commonly used and known as a *"hockey stick"* as follow;


$$
\text{Captura}(SPR) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{si } SPR \leq 0.2 \\
\frac{1}{2}(2 - 10(SPR - 0.2)^3 + 15(SPR - 0.2)^4 - 6(SPR - 0.2)^5) & \text{si } 0.2 < SPR \leq 0.5 \\
\frac{1}{2}(2 - 10(0.5 - SPR)^3 + 15(0.5 - SPR)^4 - 6(0.5 - SPR)^5) & \text{si } 0.5 < SPR \leq 0.75 \\
0 & \text{si } SPR > 0.75
\end{cases}
$$

$$
F = \begin{cases}
    F_{MSY}  & \text{if } \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} \geq 1 \\
    F_{MSY} \left( \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} - 0.2 \right) / 0.75 & \text{if } 0.2 \leq \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} < 0.75 \\
    0 & \text{if } \frac{SPR_{i,j}}{SPR_{MSY}} < 0.2
\end{cases}
$$
where *i* and *j* indicates the SPR calculated by stratum and year, and  SPR~MSY~ represent references in SPR~75%~, which is a common BRP to all stratum.  SPR calculation scheme can be easily updated each time when new data comes to be processed in modeling. The proposal for spatial adjustment and allocation of krill catch limits is not new and has considered different criteria including the catch history, predator demand and krill standing stock by Small Scale Management Unit (SSMU) [@Constable2023; @Hewitt2004; @Watters2009]. It should be noted that this control rule and spatial allocation scheme is based on a single stock assessment model for krill, it offers a tactical, operational and quantifiable procedure, which is recommended for adequate fishery management [@Punt2016], and constitutes the cutting-edge of management procedure in the exploited marine species in fishing countries [@Hilborn2020a]. It also constitutes one of the first allocation spatial catches on krill based on the management strata defined in @CCAMLR2010. 

The use of assessment models based on single stock for krill, as LBSPR, can be considered biased given that it does not incorporate ecological components. However, through this type of exercises, mechanistic relationships can be established for complex marine dynamics and, thereby, provide tactical inputs for the proper management and conservation of this species. One of the proposals to link this type of methodological approximations to the krill fisheries management, is to consider the spatial heterogeneity of krill within Subareas,  and in the next step, to regulate the fishing effort that is carried out on the fraction of juvenile individuals. This measure could bring benefits to the rest of the population in the medium and long term. In this sense, incorporating the findings regarding the changes in krill intrinsic productivity, as examined in this study, into precautionary and adaptive management strategies for this resource and its fishery is of utmost importance.

# CONCLUSION

This study undertakes the first analysis of the intrinsic productivity of krill in Subarea 48.1 using the quantitative method LBSPR (Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio). We delve into the intricate dynamics of this vital species, unraveling temporal and spatial scales within one of the regions with the greatest fishing pressure for this species. These spatio-temporal variations in intrinsic productivity serve as a fundamental basis as a management procedure, which seeks to integrate the complexities of krill  population dynamics into a framework aligned with CCAMLR revised management strategy for Subarea 48.1. The proposed management procedure based on SPR, and translate to a Harvest Control Rule, could be a quantitative element to adjust and regulate the catch limits that are currently established,  and in turn, it aligns with spatial allocation inside subarea 48.1 into stratas, which contributes to a paradigm shift towards a spatially explicit management scheme. By aligning fishing practices with the natural flows of krill productivity, this approach lays the foundation for a useful coexistence between fishing exploitation and the Antarctic ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the sustainability of this crucial marine species.
