# **Testing Intrinsic productivity in Krill at Subarea 48.1 (Antarctic Peninsula)**  

## **Overview**  

This project applies a length-based approach to assess the productivity of Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) in Subarea 48.1 (Antarctic Peninsula). Specifically, we use the **Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR)** methodology [@Hordyk2016] to estimate the sustainability of krill exploitation under data-limited conditions. The study is based on **Yield per Recruit (YPR) models**, adapted for krill fisheries using size-structured population data.  

This research is part of an **academic project** within the **Doctoral Program in Antarctic and Subantarctic Sciences** at the **Universidad de Magallanes, Chile**.  

## **Objectives**  
- Evaluate the reproductive potential of krill using **LBSPR**, a data-limited stock assessment method.  
- Analyze the impact of fishing pressure on krill size distribution and productivity.  
- Provide insights into the sustainability of krill exploitation in Subarea 48.1.  

## **Methodology**  
- **Data Source**: Length-frequency data from fishery monitoring programs.  
- **Analysis**: Implementation of the **LBSPR model** to estimate the spawning potential ratio (SPR) and its implications for krill stock resilience.  
- **Computational Approach**: R-based scripts for **automated analysis and visualization**.  

## **Reproducibility & Code**
